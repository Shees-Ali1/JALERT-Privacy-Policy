1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

a. Personal Information
Account Creation: When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and password.
User-Generated Content: Information you provide when posting incidents, warnings, feeds, chats, or replies, which may include text, images, or other media.
Location Data: With your permission, we collect precise location data to show nearby incidents, warnings, or to tag your posts with a location. You can disable location access at any time in your device settings.

Usage Data: We collect information about how you interact with the app, such as pages viewed, features used, and time spent.
Device Information: We may collect details about your device, including device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.

3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following cases:

With Other Users: Information you post (e.g., incidents, feeds, or chats) may be visible to other JAlert users, depending on your privacy settings.
With Admins: App administrators may access your posts to moderate content or add official warnings.
Service Providers: We share data with third-party providers (e.g., cloud storage, analytics, or push notification services) to operate the app. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information to comply with laws, regulations, or legal processes, or to protect the rights and safety of users or others.

Account Information: You can update your name, email, or password in the app’s settings.
Content Privacy: You can adjust privacy settings to control who sees your posts or profile.
Account Deletion: You can delete your account at any time through the app’s settings. Upon deletion, your personal information will be removed, subject to the retention policies outlined in Section 6.

5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

6. Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. If you choose to delete your account via the app’s settings, we will promptly remove your personal information, including your name, email, and password, except where required to retain it for legal or operational purposes (e.g., compliance with Jamaica’s Data Protection Act). User-generated content (e.g., posts, incidents, or chats) may remain visible to other users unless you delete it before closing your account. We may retain anonymized data for analytics purposes.

7. Children’s Privacy

JAlert is not intended for users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.

8. International Users

JAlert is designed for Jamaican users and hosted in Jamaica. If you use the app from outside Jamaica, your information may be transferred to and processed in Jamaica, where data protection laws may differ.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes via the app or email. The updated policy will be effective as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
